1.  Risks can be avoided by countering the threats facing an asset or by eliminating the exposure of an asset.(5 points)<br>
 	a. 	True<br>
 	b. 	False<br>
  
2. The defense risk treatment strategy may be accomplished by outsourcing to other organizations.(5 points)<br>
 	a. 	True<br>
 	b. 	False<br>
  
3. The criterion most commonly used when evaluating a strategy to implement InfoSec controls and safeguards is economic feasibility.(5 points)<br>
 	a. 	True<br>
 	b. 	False<br>
  
4. The risk treatment strategy that attempts to shift risk to other assets, other processes, or other organizations is known as the defense risk treatment strategy.(5 points)<br>
 	a. 	True<br>
 	b. 	False<br>
  
5. The risk treatment strategy that indicates the organization is willing to accept the current level of risk and do nothing further to protect an information asset is known as the termination risk treatment strategy.(5 points)<br>
 	a. 	True<br>
 	b. 	False<br>
  
6. In a cost-benefit analysis, the expected frequency of an attack expressed on a per-year basis is known as the annualized risk of likelihood.(5 points)<br>
 	a. 	True<br>
 	b. 	False<br>
  
7. Because even the implementation of new technologies does not necessarily guarantee an organization can gain or maintain a competitive lead, the concept of \_\_\_ has emerged as organizations strive not to fall behind technologically.(5 points)<br>
 	a. 	competitive disadvantage<br>
 	b. 	future shock<br>
 	c. 	competitive advantage<br>
 	d. 	innovation hedge<br>
  
8. Application of training and education among other approach elements is a common method of which risk treatment strategy?(5 points)<br>
 	a. 	mitigation	<br>b. 	defense<br>
 	c. 	acceptance	<br>d. 	transferal<br>
  
9.  The goal of InfoSec is not to bring residual risk to \_\_\_; rather, it is to bring residual risk in line with an organization’s risk appetite.(5 points)<br>        
 	a. 	de minimus<br>	b. 	zero<br>
 	c. 	its theoretical minimum	<br>d. 	below the cost-benefit break-even point<br>
  
10. All of the following are rules of thumb for selecting a risk treatment strategy EXCEPT:   (5 points)<br>                                
 	a. 	When a vulnerability exists in an important asset, implement security controls to reduce the likelihood of a vulnerability being exploited.	<br>
	b. 	When the likelihood of an attack is high and the impact is great, outsource security efforts so that any resulting loss is fiscally someone else’s responsibility.<br>
 	c. 	When a vulnerability can be exploited, apply layered protections, architectural designs, and administrative controls to minimize the risk or prevent the occurrence of an attack.	<br>
	d. 	When the potential loss is substantial, apply design principles, architectural designs, and technical and nontechnical protections to limit the extent of the attack, thereby reducing the potential for loss.<br>
  
11. Also known as an economic feasibility study, the formal assessment and presentation of the economic expenditures needed for a particular security control, contrasted with its projected value to the organization, is known as \_\_\_.(5 points)<br>
 	a. 	annualized loss expectancy (ALE)<br>	b. 	cost-benefit analysis (CBA) <br>
 	c. 	single loss expectancy (SLE)	<br>d. 	annualized rate of occurrence (ARO)<br>
  
12. Which of the following is NOT an alternative to using CBA to justify risk controls?(5 points)<br>
 	a. 	benchmarking	<br>b. 	due care and due diligence<br>
 	c. 	selective risk avoidance<br>	d. 	the gold standard<br>
  
13. The financial savings from using the defense risk treatment strategy to implement a control and eliminate the financial ramifications of an incident is known as \_\_\_.(5 points)<br>
 	a. 	probability estimate<br>	b. 	cost avoidance<br>
 	c. 	risk acceptance premium	<br>d. 	asset valuation<br>
  
14. By multiplying the asset value by the exposure factor, you can calculate which of the following?(5 points)<br>
 	a. 	annualized cost of the safeguard<br>	b. 	single loss expectancy<br>
 	c. 	value to adversaries<br>	d. 	annualized loss expectancy<br>

15. In which technique does a group rate or rank a set of information, compile the results, and repeat until everyone is satisfied with the result?(5 points)<br>
 	a. 	OCTAVE<br>	b. 	FAIR<br>
 	c. 	hybrid measures<br>	d. 	Delphi<br>

16. Which of the following is NOT one of the methods noted for selecting the best risk management model?(5 points)<br>
 	a. 	Use the methodology most similar to what is currently in use.<br>
 	b. 	Study known approaches and adapt one to the specifics of the organization.<br>
 	c. 	Hire a consulting firm to provide a proprietary model.<br>
 	d. 	Hire a consulting firm to develop a proprietary model.<br>
  
  
17. What does the result of a CBA determine?  What is the formula for the CBA?(10 points)<br>

18. Describe the use of hybrid assessment to create a quantitative assessment of asset value.
(10 points)<br>
