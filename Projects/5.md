## Part I
### Assume a smaller organization has a plan to implement a security program with three full-time staff and two or three groups of part-time roles from other parts of the business. What titles and roles do you recommend for the three full-time staff? What groups would commonly supply the part-time staff?
## Part II
### Assume that you are asked to recommend the professional credentials for certain roles in InfoSec at a larger organization. What is your recommendation for the credential to be held by the CISO? How about for an InfoSecManager? What would be your recommended certifications for the senior technical staff? For the last question, pick three technical roles and note the job title and recommended credential for each.
